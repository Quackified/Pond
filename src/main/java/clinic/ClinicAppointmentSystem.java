 * DATA STRUCTURES USED:
 * ====================

 * - LocalDateTime: For date and time handling
 * 
 * DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * ===============
 * - Manager Pattern: Separate managers for Patient, Doctor, and Appointment operations

 * - Utility Classes: DisplayHelper for formatting, InputValidator for validation
 * 
 * VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING:
 * ===========================
 * - Input validation for all user entries (dates, times, emails, phone numbers)
 * - Conflict detection for appointment scheduling
 * - Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
 * - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
 * - Null checks and boundary validation throughout
 * 
 * HOW TO USE:
 * ==========
 * 1. Compile all Java files in the clinic package and subpackages
 * 2. Run: java -cp bin clinic.ClinicAppointmentSystem
 * 3. Navigate through menus using numeric choices
 * 4. Follow prompts for data entry
 * 5. Sample data is pre-loaded for easy testing
 *

 * TESTING NOTES:
 * =============
 * - The system pre-loads sample data (3 patients, 3 doctors, 2 appointments)
