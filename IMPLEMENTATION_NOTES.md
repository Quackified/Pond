### ✓ User Input Validation
**Location**: `src/main/java/clinic/util/InputValidator.java`

Comprehensive validation with graceful error handling:

- **Integer Input**: Range validation (min/max bounds)
- **String Input**: Non-empty validation, optional fields
- **Email**: Regex pattern matching
- **Phone Number**: Digit count validation (10-15 digits)
- **Date**: Format validation (yyyy-MM-dd), future/past restrictions
- **Time**: Format validation (HH:mm)
- **DateTime**: Combined date and time validation
- **Gender**: Enumerated choices (Male/Female/Other)
- **Blood Type**: Valid type checking (A+, A-, B+, B-, etc.)
- **Confirmation**: Yes/no validation

All validation includes:
- Clear error messages
- Retry loops (user can correct mistakes)
- Format examples in prompts
- Graceful handling of invalid input

### ✓ Display Helpers
**Location**: `src/main/java/clinic/util/DisplayHelper.java`

Professional console output with tables and formatting:

- **Table Displays**:
  - `displayPatientTable()` - Formatted patient list with borders
  - `displayDoctorTable()` - Formatted doctor list
  - `displayAppointmentTable()` - Formatted appointment list
  
- **Detailed Views**:
  - Patient detailed info with box borders
  - Doctor detailed info with box borders
  - Appointment detailed info with box borders

- **Specialized Displays**:
  - `displayDailySchedule()` - Time-sorted daily appointments
  - `displayDailyReport()` - Statistics with formatting
  - `displayQueue()` - FIFO queue visualization
  
- **Message Helpers**:
  - `displaySuccess()` - ✓ icon with green context
  - `displayError()` - ✗ icon with red context
  - `displayWarning()` - ⚠ icon with yellow context
  - `displayInfo()` - ℹ icon with blue context

- **UI Elements**:
  - `printHeader()` - Styled section headers
  - `printDivider()` - Visual separators
  - `pressEnterToContinue()` - Pause for user review
  - `clearScreen()` - Console clearing simulation

### ✓ Undo Functionality Using Stack
**Location**: `src/main/java/clinic/manager/AppointmentManager.java` (lines 27-49, 246-295)

Stack-based undo system for appointment operations:

```java
private final Stack<AppointmentAction> undoStack;

private static class AppointmentAction {
    enum ActionType { ADD, UPDATE, CANCEL, COMPLETE }
    ActionType type;
    Appointment appointment;
    Appointment previousState;
}
```

**How it works**:
1. Every appointment operation pushes an action onto the stack
2. Action includes type, current state, and previous state
3. `undoLastAction()` pops from stack and restores previous state
4. Handles: ADD (removes appointment), UPDATE/CANCEL/COMPLETE (restores state)
5. Re-adds to queue when appropriate

**Tracking**:
- Main menu displays "Undo Available: Yes/No"
- Status shows count of undoable actions
- Queue view shows undo stack size

### ✓ Queue Processing
**Location**: `src/main/java/clinic/manager/AppointmentManager.java` (lines 21, 95-98, 230-245)

FIFO queue for appointment processing:

```java
private final Queue<Appointment> appointmentQueue;
```

**Operations**:
- `offer()` - Add appointment to queue when scheduled
- `poll()` - Remove and return next appointment
- `processNextInQueue()` - Changes status to IN_PROGRESS
- `viewQueue()` - View without removing
- `getQueueSize()` - Current queue count

**Features**:
- Appointments added automatically when scheduled
- FIFO order ensures fair processing
- Queue displayed with position numbers
- Removed from queue when cancelled/completed

### ✓ Reporting Flows
**Location**: `src/main/java/clinic/manager/AppointmentManager.java` (lines 324-366)

Comprehensive reporting capabilities:

1. **Appointment History**:
   - `getAppointmentHistory()` - Date range filtering
   - Sorted by date/time
   - All statuses included

2. **Completed Appointments**:
   - `getCompletedAppointments()` - Filter by COMPLETED status
   - Useful for billing and records

3. **Daily Report**:
   - `getDailyStatistics()` - Full breakdown by status
   - Counts for: total, scheduled, confirmed, in_progress, completed, cancelled, no_show
   - `displayDailyReport()` - Formatted output with insights
   - Calculates completion rate
   - Identifies issues (cancellations, no-shows)

### ✓ Extensive Inline Comments

Every file includes comprehensive comments:

**Class-level comments**:
- Purpose and responsibility
- Key features
- Usage examples

**Method-level comments**:
- Javadoc with parameters and return values
- Description of functionality
- Special behaviors noted

**Inline comments**:
- Control flow explanation
- Data validation steps
- Business logic clarification
- Menu navigation notes
- Error handling details

**Example from ClinicConsoleUI.java**:
```java
/**
 * Option 15: Schedule a new appointment.
 * 
 * This method guides the user through scheduling a new appointment by:
 * 1. Selecting a patient (with validation)
 * 2. Viewing and selecting an available doctor
 * 3. Entering the appointment date and time
 * 4. Providing a reason for the visit
 * 5. Validating for scheduling conflicts
 * 6. Creating the appointment and adding to queue
 * 7. Recording the action for undo capability
 */
```

```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Manager Pattern**: Separates business logic from UI
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Easy to test managers independently
   - UI layer is thin (routing only)

2. **HashMap for Storage**: O(1) lookup performance
   - Efficient ID-based retrieval
   - Suitable for in-memory storage
   - Can be replaced with database layer later

3. **Auto-incrementing IDs**: Static counter in models
   - Simple ID generation
   - Unique IDs guaranteed
   - No external ID generator needed

4. **Stack for Undo**: LIFO semantics
   - Natural undo behavior (undo most recent first)
   - Stores both current and previous state
   - Can be extended to multiple undo levels

5. **Queue for Processing**: FIFO semantics
   - Fair processing order
   - First scheduled, first processed
   - Natural workflow for appointments

6. **Enum for Status**: Type-safe status values
   - Prevents invalid status strings
   - IDE auto-completion support
   - Easy to add new statuses

## Error Handling Strategy

### Input Validation Layer
- All user inputs validated before processing
- Validation errors shown with clear messages
- Retry loops allow user to correct mistakes
- Optional fields handled gracefully

### Business Logic Layer
- Null checks on all entity lookups
- Conflict detection for appointments
- Referential checks (patient/doctor exist)
- Status transition validation

### UI Layer
- Try-catch around menu processing
- Prevents crashes from unexpected errors
- Generic error message for unknown issues
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations

### Example Error Flow
```
User enters invalid patient ID
  ↓
Manager returns null
  ↓
UI checks for null
  ↓
Displays "Patient not found" error
  ↓
Returns to menu (no crash)
```

## Sample Data

Pre-loaded for easy testing (`loadSampleData()` in ClinicConsoleUI):

**Patients**:
1. John Smith - Male, age 40, O+ blood type
2. Jane Doe - Female, age 35, A+ blood type, Penicillin allergy
3. Bob Johnson - Male, age 47, B+ blood type

**Doctors**:
1. Dr. Sarah Williams - Cardiology, weekdays 9-5
2. Dr. Michael Chen - Pediatrics, weekdays 8-4
3. Dr. Emily Brown - General Practice, Mon/Wed/Fri 10-6

**Appointments**:
1. John Smith with Dr. Williams - Tomorrow at 10:00
2. Jane Doe with Dr. Chen - Day after tomorrow at 14:30

## Performance Characteristics

- **Patient Lookup**: O(1) - HashMap
- **Doctor Lookup**: O(1) - HashMap
- **Appointment Lookup**: O(1) - HashMap
- **Search by Name**: O(n) - Linear scan
- **Queue Operations**: O(1) - LinkedList
- **Undo Operation**: O(1) - Stack pop

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

While not required for this ticket, the system is designed to easily support:

1. **Persistent Storage**: Replace HashMaps with database calls
2. **Multi-level Undo**: Stack already supports it
3. **Undo Menu Option**: Method exists, just needs UI wiring
4. **Appointment Reminders**: Add reminder queue
5. **Billing Integration**: Link to billing system
6. **User Authentication**: Add user/role management
7. **Export Features**: Add report export to PDF/CSV
8. **Multi-clinic Support**: Add clinic entity
