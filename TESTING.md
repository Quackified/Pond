## Performance Observations

### Lookup Performance
- Patient/Doctor/Appointment lookup by ID: O(1) - Instant
- Search operations: O(n) - Fast even with sample data
- Queue operations: O(1) - Instant

### Memory Usage
- Application starts quickly
- No memory leaks observed during extended testing
- Sample data loads instantly

### User Experience
- Menus are clear and well-organized
- Input prompts are descriptive
- Error messages are helpful
- Confirmation prompts prevent accidents
- Visual formatting (boxes, tables) enhances readability

## Known Behaviors

1. **Sample Data**: Application loads 3 patients, 3 doctors, 2 appointments on startup
   - This is intentional for easy testing
   - Can be removed by commenting out loadSampleData() call

2. **Undo Stack**: Tracks all appointment actions
   - Stack grows with each appointment operation
   - No limit on undo history (by design)
   - Undo is tracked but menu option to execute undo not implemented in UI
   - Undo functionality exists in AppointmentManager.undoLastAction()

3. **Conflict Detection**: 30-minute buffer between appointments
   - Prevents double-booking
   - May be strict for some use cases
   - Can be adjusted in AppointmentManager.hasConflict()

4. **Status Flow**: Natural progression
   - SCHEDULED → CONFIRMED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
   - Can also go to CANCELLED or NO_SHOW from any state
