- Provides clean separation of concerns

#### MVC-like Structure
- **Model**: Patient, Doctor, Appointment classes
- **View**: DisplayHelper for formatted output
- **Controller**: ClinicConsoleUI coordinates user interactions

#### Utility Pattern
- DisplayHelper: Formatting and display functions
- InputValidator: Input validation and parsing

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Undo Functionality
The system uses a Stack to track appointment actions:
```java
// When an action occurs
undoStack.push(new AppointmentAction(type, appointment, previousState));

// To undo
AppointmentAction action = undoStack.pop();
// Restore previous state
```

### Conflict Detection
Appointments within 30 minutes of each other for the same doctor are prevented:
```java
if (Math.abs(Duration.between(existingTime, newTime).toMinutes()) < 30) {
    return "CONFLICT";
}
```

### Queue Processing
Appointments are processed in order of scheduling:
```java
// Add to queue
appointmentQueue.offer(appointment);

// Process next
Appointment next = appointmentQueue.poll();
next.setStatus(AppointmentStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
```

# Clinic Appointment System

## Project Purpose

The Clinic Appointment System is a console-based Java application designed to manage patient appointments at a medical clinic. This system allows clinic staff to schedule, view, update, and cancel appointments efficiently through a simple text-based interface.

## Features (Planned)

- Schedule new patient appointments
- View all scheduled appointments
- Update existing appointment details
- Cancel appointments
- Simple menu-driven interface

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Terminal/Command Prompt**: For running the application

### Checking Your Java Version

To verify that Java is installed and check the version:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

If Java is not installed, download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use OpenJDK.

### Package Layout

- **`com.clinicapp`**: Main package containing the application code
  - **`ClinicAppointmentSystem.java`**: Entry point of the application with the main method

## Compilation Instructions

### Using Command Line (javac)

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/clinic-appointment-system
   ```

2. Compile the Java source files:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/main/java/com/clinicapp/ClinicAppointmentSystem.java
   ```

   This command:
   - `-d out`: Specifies the destination directory for compiled `.class` files
   - Compiles all source files in the package

3. Alternatively, compile without specifying output directory (classes will be created alongside source files):
   ```bash
   javac src/main/java/com/clinicapp/ClinicAppointmentSystem.java
   ```

## Execution Instructions

### After Compilation (with -d out option)

If you compiled with the `-d out` option:

```bash
java -cp out com.clinicapp.ClinicAppointmentSystem
```

### After Compilation (without -d option)

If you compiled without the `-d` option:

```bash
java -cp src/main/java com.clinicapp.ClinicAppointmentSystem
```

### All-in-One Compilation and Execution

For quick testing, you can compile and run in one go:

```bash
# Compile
javac -d out src/main/java/com/clinicapp/ClinicAppointmentSystem.java

# Run
java -cp out com.clinicapp.ClinicAppointmentSystem
```

## Usage

Once the application starts, you will see a welcome message and a menu with the following options:

1. Schedule new appointment
2. View all appointments
3. Cancel appointment
4. Update appointment
5. Exit system

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.

## Development Status

This project is currently in the initial skeleton/scaffolding phase. The main class has been created with placeholder comments outlining the intended functionality. Future development will implement the complete appointment management features.

## Contributing

When adding new features:

1. Follow the existing package structure
2. Maintain consistent code style and naming conventions
3. Add appropriate comments for complex logic
4. Test compilation after making changes
